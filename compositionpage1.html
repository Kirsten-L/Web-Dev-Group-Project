	  <p><strong>World, do not ask those snatched from death</strong><br>
      Nelly Sachs, Holocaust survivor and 1966 Nobel laureate</p>
		<p>World, do not ask those snatched from death<br>
		  Nelly Sachs, Holocaust survivor and 1966 Nobel laureate
		  
		  World, do not ask those snatched from death<br>
		  where they are going,<br>
		  they are always going to their graves.<br>
		  The pavements of the foreign city<br>
		  were not laid for the music of fugitive footsteps–<br>
		  The windows of the houses that reflect a lifetime<br>
		  of shifting tables heaped with gifts from a picture-book<br>
		  heaven–<br>
		  were not cut for eyes<br>
		  which drank terror at its source.<br>
		  World, a strong iron has cauterized the wrinkle of their<br>
		  smile;<br>
		  they would like to come to you<br>
		  because of your beauty,<br>
		  but for the homeless all ways wither<br>
		  like cut flowers–<br>
		  
		  But we have found a friend<br>
		  in exile: the evening sun.<br>
		  Blessed by its suffering light<br>
		  we are bidden to come to it with our sorrow<br>
		  which walks beside us:<br>
		  A psalm of night.<br>
		  <br>

	   <h3>Program Notes</h3>
      <p><em>Fugitive Footsteps</em> is a tribute to Holocaust survivors. Jewish poet Nelly Sachs survived by fleeing from Germany to Sweden in 1940, and she spent the following phase of her career bearing witness to the Holocaust through her writing. She was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature for her work. I chose her poem &ldquo;World, do not ask those snatched from death&rdquo; because it reflects the experiences of Holocaust survivors like Sachs and my mother, both of whom fled Germany and survived the war in neutral European countries. Also significant in my choice of the poem is the universality of its meaning and message, both of which address the plights of survivors of all tragedies. My hope is that my setting of Sachs&rsquo; words will promote healing, awareness, and understanding.</p>
      <p><em>Fugitive Footsteps</em> is dedicated to my mother, Alice Bacharach Sherr. Born in Egelsbach, Germany in 1931, she was sent on a <em>Kindertransport</em> to a children&rsquo;s home in Switzerland in 1939. She was the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust.</p>
