      <h3>Program Notes</h3>
      <p>Doina & Dances Overture draws on several styles found in klezmer music, the folk music genre that developed in Eastern European Yiddish culture. The overture opens with a slow doina–a Rumanian shepherd’s lament–that allows for rhapsodic expression by clarinet and violin soloists, the instruments most often featured in traditional klezmer doinas. Two upbeat dance sections follow the doina and lead to the central waltz section. While the origin of the waltz melody is unknown, it became the basis for the Yiddish song “A mame” (A Mother) when 15-year-old Khayele Poznanski of Vilna added lamenting lyrics to it after her mother was sent to a camp during the Holocaust. Khayele herself later perished in the Holocaust, but her song survived and appears in the post-war collection Lider fun di getos un lagern (Songs from the Ghettos and Camps). Following the waltz, the faster and more joyous dance sections return to conclude the overture.<br>

The DeKalb Symphony Orchestra commissioned the Doina & Dances Overture for their 50th anniversary season. After music director Fyodor Cherniavsky and I discussed possibilities for the new work, it seemed fitting to draw on the cultural heritage of our common Eastern European ancestry.</p>
